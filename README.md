# FSJS-Techdegree-ProjectFour
Project Four of the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree course work via Treehouse

I am aiming for exceeds expectations in all categories.

I have included an addtional style sheet to house the classes I added. 

The following styles were changed in the included styles.css document
- .header
- .letter
- .title
- .start
- .win
- .lose
- #btn__reset

I have also included an event listerner that allows for keyboard interaction, this checks to see if the overlay is active to allow someone to start the game by pressing enter, as well as ignoring keypresses

Last but not least, I have added some sound effects to the game.
